Numenor was the greatest kingdom of men, blessed with wisdom, long life, and unmatched seafaring power. But pride consumed its rulers, and under Ar Pharazon, they defied the Valar, seeking immortality. Led astray by Sauron, they attempted to invade the Undying Lands, provoking the wrath of Eru Iluvatar. In a great cataclysm, Numenor sank beneath the sea, its once mighty cities lost forever, with only the Faithful escaping to Middle earth to build new kingdom eventually known as Gondor.
